NGS QC Toolkit: A toolkit for the quality control (QC) of next generation sequencing (NGS) data. The toolkit comprises of user-friendly stand alone tools for quality control of the sequence data generated using Illumina and Roche 454 platforms with detailed results in the form of tables and graphs, and filtering of high-quality sequence data. It also includes few other tools, which are helpful in NGS data quality control and analysis.
